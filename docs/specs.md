# Writing Specs

Specs are instructions for coding agents. They define what to build, why, and how to verify it's done.

## Structure

### 1. Goal

State what the spec achieves in 2-3 sentences. Include a usage example if relevant.

### 2. Problem / Context (optional)

Explain *why* this is needed. What problem does it solve? What's the intent?

### 3. Deliverables

Be explicit. Communicate clearly: 
- architecture decisions (ie, use this library, and replace that library, ..), 
- design decisions (ie, will implement this module, and refactor that module, etc..), 
- data models decisions (ie, add model X, modify model X to do Y, etc), 
- tests decisions (ie, add unit test for this component, include this scenario and this scenario, etc), 
- code changes decisions (refactor that code, make this code more clean, add this here, etc..), 
- etc.

**Don't give vague instructions like "make it work" or "add tests"**

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

Checkboxes for what "done" means. Include:
- Functional requirements
- Quality gates (`uv run pytest`, `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`)
- Edge cases

### 5. File Summary

Quick reference of new/modified files.

### 6. Open Questions / Resolved Decisions

Document unknowns and decisions made during spec writing.

## Guidelines

### Code in Specs

- Code in spec is for **reference only**
- Use to clarify intent, not as actual implementation
- Communicate this clearly in the spec so agent wont copy-paste it blindly

### Completeness

Specs should strive to be **complete and unambiguous**. However:

- If a spec is unclear or incomplete, the coding agent **MUST ask clarifying questions**
- Don't assume—ask
- Better to clarify upfront than fix mistakes later
- Communicate this clearly in the spec so agent will do it.

### Quality Actions

Always require:
- `uv run pytest` - tests pass
- `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` - linting/formatting pass

### Naming

Use sequential IDs: `S001-project-setup.md`, `S002-db-scaffolding.md`, etc.
